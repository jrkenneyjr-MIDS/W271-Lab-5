Can we account for both population and miles driven simultaneously?

Does fixed effects model doesn't account for time-variant bias within changes, does it?  We're differencing both by state and time...

	Safety of cars seems like an important one
	Cultural norms (Mothers against drunk driving)

Random effect assumes that unobserved effect is not correlated with regressors
	
What does it mean if we difference out the year, but still include it in the fixed effects model?

What does heteroskedasticity do?  We know that serial/auto correlation means we reject the null hypothesis 
too easily and that our model is too liberal.

When we took the differences, seat belt became significant.  How do you explain this?  
What might have been the omitted var bias?

Two things we control for:
	Autocorrelation in observations (random effects)
	Unobserved effect -> Omitted Variable Bias (fixed effects)
